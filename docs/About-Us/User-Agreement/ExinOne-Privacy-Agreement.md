### User Data Protection Measures

To ensure the security of user information, we have implemented a series of security measures, including but not limited to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, anonymization, internal data access restrictions, and strict data encryption. However, electronic storage forms on the internet cannot guarantee 100% information security; therefore, we recommend that you understand and take independent security measures to protect personal information.

If you suspect that your personal information, especially account or password information, has been compromised, please contact platform staff immediately to freeze your account.
