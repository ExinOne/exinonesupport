## Introduction of Features

#### Market

ExinOne's "Home" page displays market information for the supported tokens, with price data from the connected exchanges. 

Prices can be calculated in two ways, adjustable through the "Pricing Method" within the user avatar on the top left corner of the ExinOne homepage. 

The "Market" page displays the top 300 tokens on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) and tokens supported by ExinOne for trading. You can "favourite"  the tokens you are interested in and set price alerts, and if the relevant token is tradable, you can choose swap, spot trading, place orders, or auto invest plan. 

#### Trading

ExinOne aggregates Binance, OKX, Bybit, Gateio, BigONE, and MixSwap exchanges, allowing you to trade tokens from these exchanges without registration or KYC, ensuring privacy and security. ExinOne offers three trading modes: Swap, Spot Trading, and limit Orders.

‚ùóÔ∏è Special Note: Digital asset prices are subject to high market risk and price volatility. The value of your investment may fluctuate and you may lose the amount invested. You are solely responsible for your investment decisions and ExinOne is not liable for any losses that may arise.

ExinOne will gradually support all the tokens of the above listed exchanges, if you want to trade a certain token but it is not currently supported by ExinOne, you are welcome to contact us and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

**Swap**

You can use the "Swap" feature to exchange any coin for any other coin, and ExinOne will automatically choose the appropriate trading path for you. If the Instant Swap feature does not have the token you want to trade, please message the ExinOne bot, and we will evaluate and inform you if we can support it.

**Spot Trading & Limit Orders**

Spot trading uses the depth of the connected exchanges, and you can perform market price and limit price trading through the Spot Trading page.

**Auto Invest Plan**

ExinOne supports creating your investment portfolio for periodic fixed investments. Deposit USDT in advance into the "AutoInvest Account" and "Savings" to make investments according to the rules when the balance is sufficient.

#### Loans

ExinOne offers collateralized borrowing services. Pledge assets in the trading account to obtain a borrowing limit, and you can borrow funds. The borrowing period is 365 days, and you can repay anytime. Please avoid overdue payments, control the collateralization rate, and avoid liquidation risks.

#### Savings

On the page of each token of Savings, the purpose of financial management is explicitly stated, and ExinOne will not trust its assets to other platforms other than Mixin, which is more secure, but high security does not mean no risk, so please make your decision carefully.
