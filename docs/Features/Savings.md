Savings is a digital currency value-added service launched by ExinOne. It is a product with low risk, stable income, and allows for flexible withdrawals.

Regarding the uses of Savings for financial management:

- USDT is used for the platform's lending business, and each lending transaction has excess asset collateral, so there is no need to worry about insufficient collateral or other risks.
- XIN is used for Mixin Network's node operation, and the node currency is collateralized to the main network, ensuring asset safety and reliability.
- EOS is used for node voting, and the assets do not need to be moved. The corresponding node rewards are obtained only through voting, ensuring asset safety and reliability.
