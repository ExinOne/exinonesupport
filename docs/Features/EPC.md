## What is EPC?

EPC (ExinOne Point Coin) is a reward point on the ExinOne platform used for Exin-related business purposes:

- Offset transaction fees: 100 EPC can offset an ExinOne transaction fee worth 1 USDT.
- Transfer authorization: When you use trading accounts and other accounts for operations, you need to enter a password and pay a small amount of EPC to enhance security.
- Deduct ExinPool node withdrawal fees: You can choose to pay with EPC to deduct the node withdrawal fee.

## How to use EPC?

If you wish to use EPC to offset ExinOne’s transaction fees, please deposit your EPC into the EPC account. You can locate it at:

> ExinOne home page top left's avatar -> Fee Card -> Transfer -> Deposit
>
> Transferring EPC from Mixin to this account will automatically deduct the fees.

❗️Special note: If the EPC you hold is not sufficient to cover the transaction fee, this order will not use EPC for fee offset.

If you are prompted to pay with EPC during trading or when exiting an ExinPool node, you need to ensure your Mixin wallet has enough EPC for payment. EPC in the EPC account can also be transferred out. Simply go to the aforementioned “Transfer” page and select "Withdraw". If you are prompted to pay with EPC during a transaction and currently do not have any EPC, you can refer to the following methods to obtain EPC:

   4. More task rewards will be launched in the future. Stay tuned.
7. **Trading Account Ranking Rewards**: ExinOne offers "ranking rewards" for tokens with good liquidity. The rewards are given to the top ten users on the respective token leaderboards. Based on the token's liquidity value, the reward quantities for the top ten users are as follows: 

| liquidity     | rewards |
| ------------- | ------- |
| over $1M      | 150 EPC |
| over $500K    | 100 EPC |
| $100K ~ $500K | 50 EPC  |
| $10K ~ $100K  | 15 EPC  |
| under $10K    | 5 EPC   |

Depending on the rankings, different proportions of rewards can be obtained:

- 1st place: 30% of the total reward amount for that token's ranking.
- 2nd place: 15% of the total reward amount for that token's ranking.
- 3rd place: 13% of the total reward amount for that token's ranking.
- 4th place: 11% of the total reward amount for that token's ranking.
- 5th place: 9% of the total reward amount for that token's ranking.
- 6th to 10th place: 4.4% of the total reward amount for that token's ranking.

 For example:

> User Peter ranks 5th in the BTC trading account leaderboard, and the liquidity of the BTC trading account exceeds 1 million US dollars. Therefore, the top ten users of the BTC trading account can receive a total of 150 EPC daily.
>
> User Peter, ranking 5th, will get 9% of the total reward (150 EPC), so during the daily reward distribution, User A will receive 13.5 EPC.
